#
# Variables
#   1) Create a variable that holds your name.
#   2) Create a variable that holds your birthday.
#   3) Create a variable that holds the name of an animal you like.
#
# Print
#   4) Print each variable, describing it when you print it.
#
# Example Code

# WRITE CODE BELOW
name = 'Brielle'
birthday = '12'
fav_animal = 'puppy'
print('my name is', name)
print('my birthday is', birthday)
print('my favorite animal is a', fav_animal)

#
# All variables created in this section should hold either an integer or float.
#
# Variables
#   1) Create a variable that holds your favorite number.
#   2) Create a variable that holds the day of the month of your birthday.
#   3) Create a variable that holds a negative number.
#   4) Create a variable that holds a floating (decimal) point number.
#
# Print
#   5) Print each variable, describing the value you print.

# WRITE CODE BELOW
fav_number = '12'
bday_month = 'June'
neg_number = '-45'
float_num = '1.34'
print('my favorite number is', fav_number)
print('my birthday month is', bday_month)
print('the negative number I have is', neg_number)
print('a float number I have is', float_num)


# 1.3 | Overwriting Variables
#
# Relevant Documentation

#   - https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_names.asp
#
# Variables
#   1) Overwrite the variable holding your name, and save a different name to it.
#   2) Overwrite the variable holding birthday with the day you think would be best to have a birthday on.
#   3) Overwrite the variable holding your favorite number and set it to a number you think is unlucky.
#
# Print
#   4) Print the variables you've overwritten, describing the values you print.
#
# Example Code

# WRITE CODE BELOW
name = 'Benz'
bday_month = 'October 31st'
fav_number = '2'
print('my new name is', name)
print('my new birthday is on', bday_month)
print('a number I think is unlucky is', fav_number)

#
# Variables
#   1) Create a variable that is the sum of two numbers.
#   2) Create a variable that is the product of three numbers.
#   3) Create a variable by dividing the previously created sum, with the previously created product.
#
#   4) Create a variable that is the concatenation of your name and an animal you like (use the variables!)
#   5) Create a variable that is an acronym (like 'lol') multiplied by your birth day.
#
#   6) Create a variable that is difference of itself minus the number you think is unlucky.
#   7) Overwrite the lucky variable with the itself squared.
#
# Print
#   7) Print all the new variables you've created along with what the represent
#
# Example Code

# WRITE CODE BELOW
sum_numbers = 5 + 10
product = 9 * 8 * 89
endproduct = sum_numbers / product
name_animal = 'Brielle' + 'puppy'
acronym = 'tbh ' * 12
dif_numbers = 70 - 2
fav_number = 12 ^2


print('the sum of 5 + 10 is', sum_numbers)
print('the product of 0 * 8 * 89 is', product)
print('the end product of the created sum and the created product is', endproduct)
print('the concatenation I created is', name_animal)
print('the acronym I created is', acronym)
print('the difference I created is', dif_numbers)
print('my new lucky number is', fav_number)
